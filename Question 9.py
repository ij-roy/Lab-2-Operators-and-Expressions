9. You are designing a software for a bank. The bank calculates interest on their RD accounts at
7.1% p.a. You need to develop the functionality, where the user can check their returns for a
given duration and for a given monthly installment amount. Note that the bank does not allow
monthly installment less than Rs. 500/- and the duration of RD should be atleast 6 months.
Check for valid and invalid inputs.

#incomplete question
p = int(input("enter the principal amount: "))
t = int(input("enter time in months: "))

if p<500 
    print("amount should not be less than 500")
